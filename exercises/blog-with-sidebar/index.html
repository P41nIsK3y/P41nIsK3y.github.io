                <h2>Woodcock</h2>
                <p>
                    The woodcocks are a group of eight very similar living 
                    species of sandpipers in the genus Scolopax. The genus 
                    name is Latin for a snipe or woodcock, and until around 
                    1800 was used to refer to a variety of waders. The 
                    English name is first recorded in about 1050. According to 
                    the Harleian Miscellany, a group of woodcocks 
                    is called a "fall".

                    cutie if I saw one in person!)

                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    Woodcocks have stocky bodies, cryptic brown and 
                    blackish plumage, and long slender bills. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their eyes are located on the sides of their heads, 
                    which gives them 360° vision. 
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center">(All the better to see you with!)</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike in most birds, 
                    the tip of the bill's upper mandible is flexible.

                    (You know what they say about early birds...)
                </p>
                <p>As their common name implies, 
                    the woodcocks are woodland birds.
                    (who could have guessed?) 
                    They feed at night or in the evenings, searching for 
                    invertebrates in soft ground with their long bills. 
                    This habit and their unobtrusive plumage makes it 
                    difficult to see them when they are resting in the day.

                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    American woodcocks occasionally perform a rocking behavior 
                    where they will walk slowly while rhythmically rocking 
                    their bodies back and forth. This behavior occurs during 
                    foraging, leading ornithologists such as Arthur Cleveland 
                    Bent and B. H. Christy to theorize that this is a method of 
                    coaxing invertebrates such as earthworms closer to the 
                    surface. The foraging theory is the most common 
                    explanation of the behavior, and it is often cited in 
                    field guides. This theory is complicated by 
                    observations of rocking while slowly walking across 
                    ground that cannot be foraged, such as hard roads or 
                    deep snow.</p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Therefore I propose an alternate theory:

                    the woodcock likes to boogie.
