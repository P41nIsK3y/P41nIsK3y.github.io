            Fearful that her ailing father will be drafted into the Chinese 
            military, Mulan (Ming-Na Wen) takes his spot -- though, as a girl 
            living under a patriarchal regime, she is technically unqualified to 
            serve. She cleverly impersonates a man and goes off to train 
            with fellow
            recruits. Accompanied by her dragon, Mushu (Eddie Murphy), 
            she uses her 
            smarts to help ward off a Hun invasion, falling in love 
            with a dashing 
            captain along the way.
