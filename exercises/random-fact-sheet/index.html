         <h4>Conditional Probability Formula</h4>
            <p>P(B|A)=P(A and B)/P(A)</p>
        <h4>Parabola Formula</h4>
            <p>y=a(x-h)<sup>2</sup>+k
            or

        <h2>Science Facts</h2>
            <p>Impossible colors are colors that do not appear in normal vision, but can be experienced
                under specific circumstances. One such color is 'stygian blue', which is simultaneously
                dark blue and black, and is caused by staring at a bright yellow surface for an extended period of
                time before looking at a black surface.
            </p>
            <p>About half of the world's oxygen production comes from phytoplankton living in the ocean, which only take up
                one percent of the global plant mass.

         <h2>Random Facts</h2>
            <p>In 1932, Australia started a "war" on emus to stop the birds from destroying crops. 
                Despite killing almost 1,000 emus in a month period, the effect on the emu population
            was minimal, and crops continued to be destroyed.  </p>
            <p>Alberta, Canada is one of the few places in the world to not have a wild rat population. Personal rat
                ownership is banned, and any wild rats brought in by accident are exterminated.  </p>
